and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Improve startup time by improving templating performance and caching filesystem access [PR #964](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/964)
- Liquid `default` filter now does not override `false` values [PR #964](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/964)

### Fixed

- Fix 3scale Batcher policy failing to cache and report requests containing app ID only [PR #956](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/956), [THREESCALE-1515](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/THREESCALE-1515)
- Auths against the 3scale backend are now retried when using the 3scale batching policy [PR #961](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/961)
- Fix timeouts when proxying POST requests to an HTTPS upstream using `HTTPS_PROXY` [PR #978](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/978), [THREESCALE-1781](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/THREESCALE-1781)
- The APIcast policy now ensures that its post-action phase only runs when its access phase ran. Not ensuring this was causing a bug that was triggered when combining the APIcast policy with some policies that can deny the request, such as the IP check one. In certain cases, APIcast reported to the 3scale backend in its post-action phase even when other policies denied the request with a 4xx error. [PR #985](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/985)

### Added

- "Matches" operation that can be used when defining conditionals [PR #975](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/975)

- Added "last" attribute in the mapping rules. When set to true indicates that, if the rule matches, APIcast should not try to match the rules placed after this one [PR #982](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/982), [THREESCALE-1344](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/THREESCALE-1344)
- Added TLS Validation policy to verify TLS Client Certificate against a whitelist. [PR #966](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/966), [THREESCALE-1671](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/THREESCALE-1671)

### Changed

- The modules used to build conditions have been extracted from the conditional policy so they can be used from other policies [PR #974](https://github.com/3scale/apicast/pull/974).
